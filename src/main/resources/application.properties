# This file is a way to configure your application. But it is not the only way
# - You can also configure your app via: ENV variables, a config server, command line args.
# - You an also replace this with multiple YML files
#    - YML files are much more production ready because we can have different files or keys per environment
#    - If you use the YML files, the .properties file can still be used for configurations that do not change with
#    environments


# General Database configuration
# By default, Spring Boot creates tables based on the entities in our packages. If we want more control,
# we use a schema.sql file.
# @see schema.sql for more info on why we need this.
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none
# See in our console output from the db
logging.level.org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.init.ScriptUtils=debug
# Just there because there is a bug in hibernate
logging.level.org.hibernate.engine.jdbc.env.internal.LobCreatorBuilderImpl=error

# Postgres specific configuration
spring.jpa.database=postgresql
spring.datasource.platform=postgres
# dev here is the database name @see start_postres.sh
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/dev
# SECRETS! In real life you would NOT put this in plain text here. Use Env vars or secrete managers.
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=postgres
